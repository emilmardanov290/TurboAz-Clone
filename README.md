# Turbo.AZ Clone

A full front-end replica of the **Tap.az / Turbo.az** website — created entirely from scratch using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Overview

This project is a self-made clone of the popular Azerbaijani classified ads platform **Tap.az / Turbo.az**.

- responsive UI design,
- dynamic rendering of car data from JavaScript,
- clean modular structure,
- and attention to UI/UX detail.
